# rl-basics
This repository aims to implement some basic algorithms in reinforcement learning on simple examples. Implemented from scratch, without using any framework?

- `./Gridworld`: Implementation of standard, tabular Q-learning on the Gridworld game of Sutton's and Barto's book.
- `./Catch`: Implementation of a DQN playing the game of catch.

# Why?
Just for fun and understanding. It's easy to use a framework, but to fully understand you'll need to implement these things from scratch!
